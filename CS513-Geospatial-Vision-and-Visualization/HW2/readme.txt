To run the Aerial Image Retrieval program, first compile the program by using the following command:
	csc AerialImageRetrieval.cs

Then run the program using:
	AerialImageRetrieval

At start, the program prompts the user to enter in four values (min/max latitude and longitude values).
The program will then download the aerial image under "test.jpg" within the same folder, and exit.
